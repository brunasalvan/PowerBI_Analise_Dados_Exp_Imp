# Data_Analysis_Exp_Imp
Analysis of export and import data for products classified under NCM 61, conducted from 2019 to 2021 across Brazil.

## About

- For this activity, I extracted data from the Federal Government portal available [here](https://dados.gov.br/dataset/estatisticos-do-comercio-exterior-brasileiro-de-bens/resource/d45d96ff-41e1-4c5e-bddd-5b633e1926a4?inner_span=True) and imported it into Power BI, where I created two dashboards (one for exports and another for imports) and conducted some analysis.
- The export and import spreadsheets available at the link are in .csv format and contain data from 1997 to 2022 for all product classifications (NCM).
- Additionally, spreadsheets for country codes and transport modes were also imported.
- The analyses derived from the dashboards are documented in "Analise_Exp_Imp_Brasil_NCM61.pdf," and the dashboards are in .pdf format.

## Technology

  - Power BI
  
## Steps
  
- [x] Loading the complete export and import .csv tables into Power BI;
- [x] Importing two additional correlation and classification tables for the "Country Code" and "Transport Mode Code" columns;
- [x] Establishing relationships between the three tables (Import/Export, Country Classification, Transport Mode Code);
- [x] Filtering the "YEAR" column for 2019 to 2021;
- [x] Filtering the "NCM" column for strings starting with 61 (the analysis was focused solely on NCM 61);
- [x] Developing the dashboards;
- [x] Analyzing and drawing conclusions from the dashboards.
